# Large Integer Factorisation Algorithm via Modular Exponential Function
This algorithm only works for a maximum of 16-digit long integers (and outputs most factors of the given input), the algorithm (Very flawed) can be modified to include longer digits and find more factors.
It works for almost any number, however, there are limitations and it will not work for some numbers.
