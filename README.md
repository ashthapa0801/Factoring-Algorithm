# Large Integer Factorisation Algorithm via Modular Exponential Function
My Dissertation topic during my time at University of Sussex.
This algorithm only works for a maximum of 16-digit long integers (and outputs most factors of the given input), the algorithm can be modified to include longer digits and find more factors.
It works for almost any number, however, there are limitations and it will not work for some numbers.
